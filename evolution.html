                    Evolution is not inherently anti-biblical. What we observe in nature - adaptation, natural
                    selection, and genetic variation - are all consistent with God's design. The issue lies not with
                    observable science, but with
                    philosophical naturalism that attempts to remove God from the equation. We can accept that God used
                    evolutionary processes while
                    maintaining that He is the ultimate creator and designer. The key is understanding that evolution
                    describes the "how" while
                    the Bible tells us the "who" and "why" of creation.

                                There is a difference between microevolution and macroevolution. Microevolution is observable and supported by evidence, while macroevolution has no direct evidence for it, but has direct evidence against it.

                                Microevolution is small changes within a species, such as the beaks on the birds Darwin is famous for. Macroevolution is an extrapolation that these minor changes could add up to create new species. 
                                An extrapolation which, despite various experiments, has only had evidence appear against it, rather than in favor of it. The biggest argument against macroevolution is irreducible complexity.

                                DNA mutations are common, but they are almost always neutral or harmful. Beneficial mutations are exceedingly rare, so much so that when testing 1.2 billion genes, not a single beneficial mutation was found.

                                This demonstrates that the likelihood of finding a beneficial mutation to a DNA sequence is so low that it is effectively impossible. 
                                This is because DNA is a highly complex system, and even a single base pair change can have a significant impact on the function of the gene.
