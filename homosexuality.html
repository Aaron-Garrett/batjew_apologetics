                    To be homosexual is as much a sin as it is to be heterosexual. That is to say, not at all. The sin for both homosexual and heterosexual people is in the actions that they take, not in their proclivities.
                    To be clear, this means whether someone is born homosexual and whether it is natural is irrelevant. We are all created "very good," as stated in Genesis 1:31a, meaning we have no right to condemn our brothers and sisters.
                    We are not only allowed to love someone of the same sex, but we are encouraged to. However, to <b>make</b> love to that person is a different matter entirely. 
                    All people are encouraged to abstinence and told only to marry if they find the path of abstinence too difficult. This may seem unfair to homosexuals, but research shows that most
                    homosexuals are still attracted to the opposite gender to some degree. For those who are not, it is, unfortunately, a very difficult cross to bear. Yet, as a community, we are called to
                    support and love those individuals. To lead them to the cross that Jesus bore for us. We do not guide them by looming over and condeming them, blocking the saving light of Christ because all they can see is
                    our anger and yelling. We guide them by stepping aside with love and allowing them to see the brightness of Christ that supports us. People are brought to repentance
                    via love and kindness, not condemnation. It is not our place to tell a person they are sinful. Those of us who deal with homosexuality are still encouraged
                    to have deep and meaningful relationships with people of the same gender.

                                The vast majority of homosexuals are some level of bisexual, rather than exclusively attracted to the same sex.

                                One of the arguments for homosexuality being natural is that it is found in nature. And it is a very rare phenomenon in other species, but there are some caveats.

                                1. Most species that display this behavior do so due to lack of opposite-gender partners<br>
                                2. Many species that display this behavior still mate with the opposite gender<br>
                                3. Most cases in nature are actually displays of social heirarchy than attraction<br>
                                4. Animals that mate for the sexual release are being controlled by hormones and instincts and are not making a conscious choice.
