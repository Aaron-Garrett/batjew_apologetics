                    Being homosexual is not a "sin". The reality is that the sinful part is not much different than that of a heterosexual person, acting on innappropriate sexual desires. You are allowed to love
                    another person of the same gender, in fact, we are called to love them. However, to marry, make love to, or kiss him/her is a different matter entirely. People say that people are born
                    this way and that it is totally natural. This is not relevant. We are called to love all people and walk alongside them in their struggles. All of this to say: people are brought to repentance
                    via love and kindness, not condemnation. It is not our place to tell a person they are sinful. We are created "very good," but we perform <i>acts</i> that are sinful. To clarify, it is not biblical
                    to say that a person is sinful, but rather that they have performed sinful acts. One is a value statement. The other is an observation. Those of us who deal with homosexuality are still encouraged
                    to have deep and meaningful relationships with people of the same gender. The limit comes in the physical intimacy space. The same goes for heterosexuals. We are only allowed physical intimacy
                    with our spouse, and no one else.

                                The vast majority of homosexuals are some level of bisexual, rather than exclusively attracted to the same sex.

                                One of the arguments for homosexuality being natural is that it is found in nature. And it is a very rare phenomenon in other species, but there are some caveats.

                                The caveats are: <br>
                                1. Most species that display this behavior do so due to lack of opposite-gender partners<br>
                                2. Many species that display this behavior still mate with the opposite gender<br>
                                3. Most cases in nature are actually displays of social heirarchy than attraction<br>
                                4. Animals that mate for the sexual release are being controlled by hormones and instincts and are not making a conscious choice.
