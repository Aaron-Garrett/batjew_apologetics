                    There is always grace for those who have chosen this path. Our place is not to judge those who are
                    lost,
                    but to guide them
                    through kindness and love to the truth. And the truth of this matter is as follows: a "fetus" is a
                    baby.
                    G-d has created this life by
                    combining both unique gametes into the unique first cell of a new human being. Within that cell is
                    the
                    entirety of that being's physical characteristics
                    and within the soul placed within it is the entirety of that person's personality and value. Unlike
                    they
                    physical characteristics, the soul is not
                    growing in the mother's womb, but is already fully formed and complete. Our value does not come from
                    our
                    body, but from our soul. Therefor, to kill the soul
                    of a fetus is to kill a child of G-d.
